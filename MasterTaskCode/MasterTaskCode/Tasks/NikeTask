Expected behavior:
On Launch, the user should see a table view or collection view showing one album per cell. Each cell should display the name of the album, the artist, and the album art (thumbnail image).
Tapping on cell should push another view controller onto the navigation stack where we see a larger image at the top of the screen and the same information that was shown on the cell, plus genre, release date and copyright info below the image.
A button should also be included on this second view that when tapped fast app switches to the album page in the iTunes store. The button should be centered horizontally and pinned 20 points from the bottom of the view and 20 points from the leading and trailing edges of the view.
Unlike the first one, this "detail" view controller should NOT use a Tableview for layout.
Please spend no more than a few hours on the project.
